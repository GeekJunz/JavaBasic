This is the summary of java basic skills like java collections, multiThread, IO and some other knowledge.
As the creator, and a coder,of course a new bee! I wish to learn, note down and share my the experience and skills. In addition, i will make some test here, to test some issuses and make a summary.

Anyone will be welcomed to see and download the code and make comments or provide your suggests. I will be glad to accept it, and learn from yours and update the code continously. Let's grow together!
